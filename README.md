## Google Visualization Graphs:
### Chart 1: Sales.html

The graph is designed to show how the total sales value was driven 
along the first quarter of the year, this is strategic analysis and
the chart would grow as long the rest of the year advances. I did just 
one quarter since the dataset just held data for the first 3 months of the year.

### Chart 2: Product.html

The chart is designed to display in an Excel sheet type of chart the values of the product categories
in terms of sales value. This could go integrated with the line chart and might be filtered to see
how each product categories developed along the first quarter.
